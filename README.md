# astro-presents
Placeholder for an OSS presentation / slides template built using Astro.

Once the next release of Astro is available, I'll take the structure from my
[Astro/Cloudflare presentation](https://github.com/justinnoel/code-demos-upc-lookup-presentation)
and make this an open source project. Anyone will be able to use this to createsimple presentations using Astro.
